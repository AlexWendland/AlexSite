# AlexSite

This was an old django project, I planned on making my website. I have abandonned it, still working out what form I want my website to take.

## Setup

## CI/CD

Use the github action to build and push the image to my image repo. Do this by pushing a tag e.g.

```
git tag 1.0.0
git push --tag
```

This can then be hosted on my server.
