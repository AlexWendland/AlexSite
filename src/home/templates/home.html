		<p>This is just proof I, Alex Wendland, exist. This site contains 
			information about me and acts as a database of my life experiences. 
			Also, I am using it to try out some ideas.</p>
        
		<p>I am a civil servant on the 
			<a href="https://www.faststream.gov.uk/">Science and Engeeneering 
			Fast Stream</a>. Previously, I did my PhD at the University of 
			Warwick under the supervision of 
			<a href="https://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/~maslar/"> Agelos 
			Georgakopoulos</a>.</p>
		
        <p>My interests are in programming and data. Infact I started this 
			website to develop my python, javascript, HTML and SQL skills a 
			little more. This shows my hand in the fact that I am a project 
			based learner.</p>
		
		<p>Next goal is to become more interesting so I have something more to 
			put here.</p>
